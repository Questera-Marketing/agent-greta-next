## HRMS Development in the Era of AI Agents: A Founder's Guide

Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) have historically been the "least loved" software in the enterprise stack. Often clunky, slow, and overly complex, traditional HRMS platforms act as hurdles rather than helpers. However, in 2026, the rise of **AI Agents** and **Growth Engineering** has transformed HR from a back-office function into a strategic growth driver. Using **Greta**, you can build a custom HRMS that is autonomous, secure, and engineered for the modern workforce.

### The Problem: The Legacy HR Friction
Why do employees hate their HR software?
1. **The Request Cycle:** Simple tasks like requesting time off or viewing a payslip require navigating complex menus.
2. **Disconnected Data:** Employee performance data rarely syncs with growth objectives.
3. **Static Compliance:** Keeping up with changing labor laws is a manual, error-prone nightmare.

Building with Greta allows you to bypass these legacy pitfalls by utilizing **Agent Mode** and **Native Deployment**.

### The Vision: The Autonomous People Platform
An AI-native HRMS doesn't just store data; it manages the "vibe" of your organization.
- **Agentic Onboarding:** AI agents that guide new hires through paperwork, hardware setup, and cultural immersion.
- **Predictive Retention:** Algorithms that flag burnout by analyzing engagement patterns and sentiment.
- **Growth Loops:** Linking individual performance directly to company-wide OKRs.

### Technical Architecture: Security First
HR data is some of the most sensitive data a company holds. Greta ensures your HRMS is built on a "Production-Logic" foundation.

#### 1. Secure Multi-Tenancy & RLS
Greta leverages **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** to ensure that an employee can only see their own data, while managers have appropriate oversight. You can vibe-code these complex policies: *"Ensure all salary data is encrypted and only accessible by the 'HR-Admin' role."*

#### 2. Agent Mode: The Virtual HR Assistant
Integrate a conversational interface that handles the "grunt work."
- *"Build a Slack bot that allows employees to book time off using natural language."*
- *"Create an automated payroll engine that calculates tax based on the employee's location."*

#### 3. Native Deployment & Performance
By deploying natively to **AWS or GCP** via Greta, your HRMS remains fast even during peak periods (like open enrollment). High performance isn't just a luxury; it's essential for employee adoption and SEO (for public-facing careers pages).
