## The Ultimate Guide to Building a POS with AI: Retail's New Standard

In 2026, the Point of Sale (POS) system has moved out of the hardware box and into the cloud-native, AI-agentic ecosystem. Whether you're building for a boutique retail shop or a multi-location restaurant, the standard is now **Growth Engineering**. A POS is no longer just a transaction terminal; it's a conversion engine. This guide shows you how to use **Greta AI** to build a modern POS that handles payments, inventory, and growth autonomously.

### The Problem: Legacy POS Fragmention
Traditional POS systems are often:
1. **Disconnected:** Inventory and sales data live in different silos.
2. **Laggy:** Browser-based tools often feel slow during a lunch rush.
3. **Growth-Blind:** They track what was sold, but they don't help you sell more.

Building with Greta allows you to create a **Native Deployment** solution that is fast, resilient, and growth-focused.

### The Vision: The Agentic Commerce Hub
A 2026 POS built with Greta focuses on "active" commerce.
- **Agentic Inventory:** The system doesn't just track stock; it reorders from suppliers and updates the "vibe" of your online store automatically.
- **Dynamic Upselling:** AI agents that suggest add-ons at the register based on the customer's purchase history.
- **Multi-Channel Sync:** Seamlessly bridge the gap between your physical store and your online marketplace.

### Technical Architecture: Engineered for Uptime
Greta builds your POS on a foundation of reliability and speed.

#### 1. SQL-Backed Offline Resilience
A POS cannot fail when the internet does. Greta helps you build systems with **local-first** logic. *"Create a POS architecture that syncs to a local SQLite DB and pushes to Supabase once the connection is restored."*

#### 2. Agent Mode: The Intelligent Clerk
Use Greta's Agent Mode to build high-value features:
- *"Integrate an AI camera that can identify products on a tray and add them to the bill instantly."*
- *"Build an automated loyalty program that texts customers a personalized discount when their favorite items are back in stock."*

#### 3. Native Deployment & Portability
With Greta, your POS lives on professional infrastructure (**Vercel, AWS**). This ensures that your inventory API is always fast, which is critical for both checkout speed and SEO-driven product availability searches.
