## ERP Systems: Building with AI for Scale in 2026

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) used to be the exclusive domain of massive corporations with multi-million dollar budgets. Names like SAP and Oracle dominated the field with complex, difficult-to-use software. In 2026, the landscape has been democratized. Using **Greta AI**, a founding engineer can build a custom ERP tailored to a startup's unique needs in a fraction of the time. This is the era of the **Growth ERP**—a system designed not just for management, but for scaling.

### The Problem: ERP Rigidity vs. Startup Speed
Traditional ERPs fail startups because they are:
1. **Too Generic:** They try to be everything to everyone and end up being right for no one.
2. **Technical Debt Factories:** Customizing one often breaks the core system.
3. **Data Black Holes:** Information goes in, but getting actionable growth insights out is a struggle.

Building with Greta utilizes **Native Deployment** and **Agent Mode** to create a system that evolves with your business.

### The Vision: The Intelligent Growth ERP
A modern ERP built with Greta focuses on the "flow" of your business.
- **Autonomous Supply Chain:** AI agents that negotiate with vendors and optimize shipping routes.
- **Unified Growth Engine:** Connecting finance, inventory, and marketing data into a single source of truth.
- **Agentic Financials:** Automated reporting and tax compliance handled by AI agents.

### Technical Architecture: The Production Foundation
Greta ensures your ERP is built for enterprise-grade reliability.

#### 1. Complex Schema Management
An ERP requires a multi-table, highly relational database. Greta handles the heavy lifting: *"Build an ERP schema that links Purchase Orders, Invoices, Warehouse Stock, and Customer Accounts. Use UUIDs for all records and implement full audit logging."*

#### 2. Agent Mode: The Intelligent Controller
Use Greta to build agentic workflows that prevent bottlenecking:
- *"Create an AI agent that monitors cash flow and alerts the CEO if the 'Burn Rate' exceeds the monthly budget."*
- *"Build an automated 'Closing' engine that reconciles all books at the end of the month."*

#### 3. Native Deployment & Security
Security is paramount for an ERP. Greta deploys your system to **AWS or GCP** with built-in encryption and VPC configurations. Because you own the code in GitHub, you can audit every line for compliance.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial
Building an ERP with Greta is an exercise in organizing your business logic.

**Step 1: The Core Module (Inventory/Finance)**
Start with the most critical part of your business. *"Build a finance module that tracks accounts payable and receivable. Connect it to our bank API using Plaid."*

**Step 2: Connecting the Agency**
Add the "smart" features. Ask Greta to integrate:
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use historical data to forecast next quarter's sales.
- **Automated Workflows:** *"If a client is 7 days late on an invoice, have the agent send a friendly reminder via email."*

**Step 3: Growth Engineering & SEO**
ERP systems can also drive growth. Greta includes:
- **B2B Portal SEO:** Optimize your wholesale ordering pages for search.
- **Conversion Tracking:** Monitor which products have the highest margin and redirect marketing spend accordingly.
