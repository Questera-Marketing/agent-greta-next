## Build a Real-time Chat App with AI: Communication Reimagined

In 2026, a "chat app" is no longer just about sending text bubbles back and forth. It is an intelligent communication layer where AI agents act as translators, moderators, and facilitators. Whether you're building a niche community tool or a corporate communication powerhouse, the standard is **Growth Engineering**. This guide will show you how to use **Greta AI** to build a real-time, AI-enhanced chat application that is engineered for conversion and community growth.

### The Problem: The Noise of Traditional Messaging
Most chat apps suffer from:
1. **Information Overload:** Long threads make it impossible to find actionable items.
2. **Maintenance Burden:** Manual moderation of large groups is a full-time job.
3. **Ghost Towns:** New users often feel lost, leading to high churn rates.

Building with Greta utilizes **Agent Mode** and **Native Deployment** to create a chat experience that is active, not passive.

### The Vision: The Agentic Chat Ecosystem
A 2026 chat app built with Greta focuses on "active" communication.
- **AI Thread Summaries:** Agents that provide TL;DRs for busy users.
- **Autonomous Moderation:** Sentiment analysis and spam prevention built into the core.
- **Intent-Based Actions:** Type "let's meet" and the AI agent suggests a time and creates a calendar link.

### Technical Architecture: Real-time & Resilient
Greta builds your chat app using modern, high-performance tech stacks (Next.js, Socket.io/Supabase Realtime, Tailwind).

#### 1. Real-time Infrastructure
Greta handles the complex websocket orchestration. *"Build a chat architecture that support private messaging, group rooms, and real-time typing indicators. Use Supabase for auth and message persistence."*

Use Greta's Agent Mode to build intelligent features:
- *"Build an AI moderator that auto-hides toxic messages and alerts admins."*
- *"Integrate a 'Smart Reply' engine that suggests responses based on the conversation's context."*

#### 3. Native Deployment & SEO
