The education sector is undergoing a massive transformation. In 2026, the static course is dead. Students want **Adaptive Learning**—education that reacts to their progress, clarifies their doubts, and personalizes the curriculum. Whether you are an expert sharing your knowledge or an enterprise training your team, you need a platform that is as smart as its students. Building with **Greta AI** allows you to create an AI-first Learning Management System (LMS) designed for growth and engagement.

### The Shift to Adaptive Education
Traditional LMS platforms (the 2.0 era) were essentially "video players with a quiz." LMS 3.0 is characterized by:

- **AI Tutoring:** A 24/7 assistant that can answer questions about the course content.
- **Continuous Growth:** Integrated mechanisms to keep students moving to the next level (and the next purchase).

### Building with Intent: The Greta Workflow
Vibe coding your learning platform with Greta focus on both the "what" and the "how."

#### 1. The Autonomous Tutor
Prompt Greta: *"Build an LMS where every lesson has an AI chat assistant. This assistant should only answer based on the provided course material and my Knowledge Base."*

#### 2. Growth Engineering in Education
- **Conversion Loops:** *"Add a feature that offers a discount on the 'Advanced level' course when a student completes 90% of the 'Basics' level."*
- **Gamification:** Build a skill-tree that visually updates as the student progresses, driving engagement.

### SEO and Reach: Why Education Needs Growth Tech
