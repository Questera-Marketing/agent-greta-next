Replit changed the world with their cloud-based IDE, and their Agent is a powerful tool for rapid prototyping. However, when we talk about **Vibe Coding** for production, Greta takes a fundamentally different approach.

### 1. Developer Control & Portability
Replit aims to keep you in their ecosystem. Greta is built on the philosophy of **Portability**. Your code, your GitHub, your choice of infra. Greta builds your app to live anywhere, giving you the freedom that founding engineers demand.

### 2. Built-in Growth Engineering
While Replit is a general-purpose IDE, Greta (Growth Engineering Tech Agent) is specialized. We don't just build the code; we build the marketing hooks, the SEO paths, and the conversion funnels. Greta understands that a startup needs more than just a running script—it needs a product that scales and sells.

### 3. State Management & Complexity
For complex full-stack apps, Greta's Agent Mode excels at maintaining context across deep directory structures. Whether it's complex Redux logic or Supabase RLS policies, Greta is engineered for the "hard stuff" of production software.
