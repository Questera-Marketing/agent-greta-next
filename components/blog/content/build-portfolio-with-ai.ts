For developers, designers, and creators in 2026, your portfolio is your most valuable product. It's often the first (and sometimes only) impression a potential client or employer gets. A static, one-size-fits-all portfolio is no longer enough. You need a site that is as intelligent as the work you do. Vibe coding with **Greta AI** allows you to build a portfolio that isn't just a gallery—it's a high-converting growth machine.

### The Problem with Static Portfolios
- **Irrelevant Content:** A CTO doesn't want to see the same thing a recruiter sees.
- **Low Engagement:** There is no path for the visitor to take after looking at a project.
- **Stale Data:** Portfolios are notoriously difficult to keep updated.

### Intelligent Personalization (The Greta Edge)
Imagine a portfolio that changes based on who is viewing it. With **Greta AI**, building this level of intelligence is just a prompt away.

#### 1. Role-Based Viewports
Prompt Greta: *"Build a portfolio that detects if the visitor is from a 'Design' or 'Eng' background (via URL params or interaction) and prioritizes either my Figma prototypes or my GitHub commits accordingly."*

#### 2. AI Project Summaries
Instead of writing long case studies, use Greta to:
- Automatically generate a "TL;DR" for your projects.
- Highlight the specific tech stack and the impact of each project.
- Create interactive live demos that users can play with.

#### 3. Growth Modules for Personal Brands
- **Lead Capture:** Integrated "Book a Call" or "Download Resume" buttons that track conversion rates.
- **Analytics Sync:** Seamless integration with Google Analytics 4, configured automatically by Greta.

### SEO for Creators
You want people to find your work when they search for "Top React Dev 2026." Greta builds for search:
- **Automatic Metadata:** For every project page you add.
- **Blazing Fast Performance:** A 100/100 Lighthouse score helps you rank above the competition.
- **Mobile Perfection:** Ensuring your work looks stunning on any screen.

### Architectural Integrity: Own Your Code
Your portfolio should be as professional as the code you write. 
- **GitHub-Synced:** Your portfolio code is in your repo.
- **Native Deployment:** No third-party branding or host limitations.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built on the same stack the unicorns use.
