Vibe coding is about moving as fast as you can think. But not all AI builders are created equal. When comparing **Greta** and **Lovable**, the difference lies in the transition from prototype to production.

### 1. Architecture: Production vs. Prototype
While Lovable is exceptional for rapid UI mockups and "vibe" sharing, Greta is built for **founding engineers** who need to maintain code integrity. Greta generates code that follows industry best practices (MERN, SQL, etc.), whereas prototype speed can sometimes lead to technical debt in other tools.

### 2. Growth Engineering Focus
Greta isn't just about code; it's about the entire lifecycle. With built-in modules for SEO, analytics, and conversion tracking, your app is engineered for growth from the first prompt. This is why Questera users move faster—not just in building, but in scaling.`;
