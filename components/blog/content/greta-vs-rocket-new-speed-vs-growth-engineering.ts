When it comes to building and deploying apps at the speed of thought, **Greta** and **Rocket.new** are two of the most discussed tools in the ecosystem. While Rocket.new offers a sleek, opinionated path to launching browser-based projects, Greta (Growth Engineering Tech Agent) is designed for the long game: **production agility and growth.**

### 1. Architectural Integrity vs. Instant Deployment
Rocket.new is fantastic for projects that need to be live "yesterday." It's optimized for the fastest possible deployment from a prompt. However, Greta is built for **Founding Engineers**. Greta generates clean, modular code following MERN or SQL best practices that you can actually maintain, scale, and audit.

### 2. Built-in Growth Engineering
Rocket focuses on the *launch*. Greta focuses on the *growth*. Every app built with Greta comes with optional, intelligent modules for:
- **SEO Optimization:** Headings, metadata, and sitemaps are first-class citizens.
- **Analytics Integration:** Ready-to-go hooks for tracking user behavior.
- **Conversion Loops:** Built-in logic for customer acquisition.

### 3. Logic Complexity
While Rocket.new excels at standardized web patterns, Greta shines in **complex state management** and **multi-step backend logic**. Whether you are coordinating complex Supabase RLS policies or building custom Redux flows, Greta's Agent Mode understands the depth of production-grade software architecture.

### 4. Ownership and Portability
Rocket.new often keeps you within its optimized hosting and environment. Greta is built on the philosophy of **Portability**. Your code lives in your GitHub and deploys to your chosen infrastructure (Vercel, AWS, GCP, etc.), ensuring no vendor lock-in as your startup grows.

### Conclusion: Why Choose Greta?
If you want to build a quick prototype for a hackathon, Rocket.new is great. But if you are building an **AI-first startup** that needs to scale, convert, and evolve, Greta is the growth engine you need.
