The job market in 2026 is an engineering problem. Recruiters are using AI to screen resumes, and candidates must use AI to be seen. A simple Word document is no longer sufficient. You need an **AI Resume Builder**—a tool that analyzes job descriptions, optimizes keywords in real-time, and ensures your data is structured for both humans and ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). In this guide, we'll build this tool using **Greta AI**, focusing on architectural integrity and growth.

### The Modern Job Search Paradigm
In 2026, a "generic" resume is a "rejected" resume. Every application must be tailored. But manual tailoring doesn't scale. An AI Resume Builder solves this by:
- **Analyzing Jobs:** Parsing the specific "vibe" of a job description.
- **Keyword Alignment:** Ensuring your skills match the recruiter's filter.
- **Stylistic Optimization:** Generating clean PDF and Web versions of your CV.

### Building the Tool with Greta AI
Using Greta's specialized Growth Engineering Tech Agent, you can vibe-code a resume builder that is more than just a form.

#### 1. The Intelligent Editor
Prompt Greta: *"Build a resume builder where I upload my master profile once. I need a feature that takes a job URL and automatically creates a new version of my resume focused on the specific requirements of that role."*

#### 2. Beyond the PDF
A modern resume is a live data object. Use Greta to:
- **Build a Web API for your career:** *"Create a secure endpoint that returns my professional history in JSON format for custom job board integrations."*
- **SEO-Optimized Public Profile:** Build a public-facing page that helps you get headhunted via organic search.

### Growth Engineering for Your Career
This tool isn't just for you; it's a product you can scale.
- **Premium Tiers:** Use Greta to integrate Stripe and charge for "Advanced ATS Checks."
- **Social Sharing:** Modules to instantly update your LinkedIn or Twitter "About" section based on your latest resume version.
