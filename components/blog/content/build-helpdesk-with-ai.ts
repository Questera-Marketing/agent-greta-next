The era of the "support ticket" is dying. Customers in 2026 don't want to wait 24 hours for a response; they want a resolution in 24 seconds. For businesses scaling at speed, the traditional helpdesk is a bottleneck that burns out staff and frustrates users. The solution is an **Autonomous AI Helpdesk**—a system that doesn't just manage tickets but solves problems. Using **Greta AI**, the specialized Growth Engineering Tech Agent, you can build a support powerhouse that grows with your user base.

### From Ticketing to Resolution
A modern helpdesk isn't a CRM; it's an **Action Engine**. Most bots just link to documentation, but a Greta-built AI agent can actually *do* the work.

#### 1. Intent-Based Routing
Traditional keyword bots fail when a customer is vague. Greta AI helps you build a helpdesk that understands intent. Whether the user says "I can't get in" or "Forgot my pass," the AI recognizes the underlying problem and initiates the correct workflow.

This architecture is similar to our [AI Inventory Management](/blog/build-inventory-with-ai) logic.`;
