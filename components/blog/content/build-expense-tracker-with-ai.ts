The financial technology (FinTech) revolution of the last decade has democratized many aspects of money management. However, many users still find themselves trapped in a cycle of manual receipt entry and spreadsheet maintenance. In 2026, the standard for personal and business finance is **Automation**. In this guide, we will explore how to use **Greta AI**, the next-gen Growth Engineering Tech Agent, to build an AI-driven expense tracker that turns the "vibe" of financial clarity into a live, scalable application.

By using **Greta AI**, you aren't just building a UI with some input fields. You are building a system that understands the context of your spending.
