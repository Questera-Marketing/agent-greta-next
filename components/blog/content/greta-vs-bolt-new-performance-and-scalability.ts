Bolt.new relies on WebContainer technology. It is a masterpiece of engineering for running Node.js in the browser, but production apps live in the cloud, not the chrome tab. **Greta** provides the bridge between the prompt and professional infrastructure.

### Why Greta Wins on Infra
1. **Native Deployment:** Unlike browser-bound environments, Greta hooks directly into your hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, GCP).
2. **Deep DB Integration:** Greta understands Supabase and MongoDB at a schema level, not just as an API endpoint.
3. **Scalability:** When your traffic grows, a Greta-built app is already structured to handle the load.
